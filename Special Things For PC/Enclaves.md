# Netherese Enclave
An enclave was a floating city built by the Netherese before the fall of Netheril.

They were powered by a mythallar, a massive crystal that released large amounts of raw magical energy.

The Netherese used an epic magic spell called Proctiv's move mountain, which cut the top off a mountain, flipped it over, and floated it through the air so they could build a city on the flat surface.

They then put one of these [[Mythallar]] inside of it causing it to float or fly.

During WW2 there were only 12. During the war 3 were destroyed and crashed into the ocean or rural areas. 2 were destroyed above cities, and 1 was intentionally detonated in the air above a capital. That leaves 6 left. 3 Belong to the CRR and their allies. 2 Belong solely to the USSR. And one has been left inactive as the Mythallar never ignited, and thus was never installed in a plot of land.
