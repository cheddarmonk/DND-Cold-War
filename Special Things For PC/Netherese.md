## Netherese
The **Netherese**, also known as the **Neth**,[[2]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Netherese#cite_note-sp-2) were an ethnic group of dark-haired, fair-skinned [humans](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Human "Human") that resided in the ancient magocratic nation of [Netheril](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Netheril "Netheril"). Many cultures and ethnic groups in [Faerûn](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Faer%C3%BBn "Faerûn") were either descendants or absorbed into the Netherese people, such as the [Shadovar](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Shadovar "Shadovar"), the [Halruaans](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Halruaan_(ethnicity) "Halruaan (ethnicity)"), the [Bedine](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Bedine "Bedine"), and the [Illuskans](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Illuskan "Illuskan"), among others.[[1]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Netherese#cite_note-RoF-p107-1) Only a few select groups of pure-blood Netherese still existed on [Toril](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Toril "Toril") as of the 14th century [DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/DR "DR"), over a thousand years after the fall of the great Empire of Magic.[[3]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Netherese#cite_note-RoF-p108-3)

The Netherese had always lived in a hierarchical magocracy, that was seperated into the flying enclaves of High Netheril and the cities of Low Netheril located around the [Narrow Sea](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Narrow_Sea "Narrow Sea"). While the people shared a common script of [draconic alphabet](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Draconic_alphabet "Draconic alphabet"), the people of Low Netheril spoke [Netherese](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Netherese_language "Netherese language") while the nobles of High Netheril spoke [Loross](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Loross "Loross"). The reason for two languages was due to separation of the classes.[[1]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Netherese#cite_note-RoF-p107-1)

## History

Following the [fall of the High Netheril](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Karsus%27s_Folly "Karsus's Folly") in the 4th century before [Dale Reckoning](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Dale_Reckoning "Dale Reckoning"), the survivors of three cities of High Netheril, [Anauria](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Anauria "Anauria"), [Asram](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Asram "Asram"),[[1]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Netherese#cite_note-RoF-p107-1) and [Hlondath](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Hlondath "Hlondath"), along with the commoners of Low Netheril spread out from [northern Faerûn](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/North_Faer%C3%BBn "North Faerûn") across the rest of the realms. The enclave of [Thultanthar](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Thultanthar "Thultanthar") managed to survive the cataclysmic destruction by magically shifting into the [Shadowfell](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Shadowfell "Shadowfell").[[3]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Netherese#cite_note-RoF-p108-3)

High Netherese

As the "Netherese survivor states" continually fell to external forces, Anauria in [111 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/111_DR "111 DR") and Hlondath in [329 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/329_DR "329 DR"), the last-living people of High Netheril migrated south into what would be [Cormyr](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Cormyr "Cormyr") and east into the [Moonsea](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Moonsea "Moonsea") region. They were absorbed into the burgeoning [Chondathan](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Chondathan "Chondathan") and [Vaasan](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Vaasan "Vaasan") ethnic groups of humans.[[3]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Netherese#cite_note-RoF-p108-3)

Low Netherese

The people of Low Netheril, referred to as the _free folk_,[[4]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Netherese#cite_note-LEoF-p105-4) mostly endured Karsus's Folly, but had their essence and life force drained by the [Phaerimm](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Phaerimm "Phaerimm"). Sometime around the mid-5th century [DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/DR "DR") they began migrating westward, fracturing into two groups in the process. One group moved northwest to the [Savage Frontier](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Savage_Frontier "Savage Frontier") and merged with the [Illuskan](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Illuskan "Illuskan") people, while the others went southwest into the [Western Heartlands](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Western_Heartlands "Western Heartlands") where coalesced with the native [Tethyrian](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Tethyrian "Tethyrian") tribes.[[3]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Netherese#cite_note-RoF-p108-3)

### Pureblood Netherese

As of the 14th century, only four groups of pureblood Netherese humans were known to exist on Faerûn.[[3]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Netherese#cite_note-RoF-p108-3)

-   [Marsh Drovers](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Marsh_Drover "Marsh Drover") of the [Farsea Marshes](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Farsea_Marshes "Farsea Marshes") in Cormyr were believed to be descended from the people of Anauria who never integrated with the Chondathan population.[[3]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Netherese#cite_note-RoF-p108-3)
-   The barbarians of the [Tunlands](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Tunlands "Tunlands") were descendants of the [Rengarth](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Rengarth "Rengarth") tribe, cousins of the commoners of Low Netheril.[[3]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Netherese#cite_note-RoF-p108-3)
-   There was a tribe of nomadic barbarians in [the Ride](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/The_Ride "The Ride"), north of the Moonsea, whose distant ancestry could be traced back to Low Netheril.[[3]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Netherese#cite_note-RoF-p108-3)
-   The Netherese of Thultanthar survived for over a thousand years in the plane of Shadow, and came to be known as the Shadovar.[[3]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Netherese#cite_note-RoF-p108-3)
