## Loulaum

**Ioulaum** was a great archwizard of [Netheril](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Netheril "Netheril"), a beloved champion of his people and the inventor of both the [mythallar](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Mythallar "Mythallar") and the flying enclaves of his empire.[[2]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Ioulaum#cite_note-LEoF-p101-2) When Ioulaum abandoned Netheril to escape the _life drain_ dweomers of the [phaerimm](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Phaerimm "Phaerimm") in [−339 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/-339_DR "-339 DR"), panic spread at the news of his disappearance, leading to [Karsus](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Karsus "Karsus") casting his spell _[Karsus's avatar](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Karsus%27s_avatar "Karsus's avatar")_.[[5]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Ioulaum#cite_note-N.EoM.2FWoN-p11-12-5) After the fall of Netheril, Ioulaum survived as an [elder brain](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Elder_brain "Elder brain") (the central brain of an [illithid](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Illithid "Illithid") community) [lich](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Lich "Lich").[[2]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Ioulaum#cite_note-LEoF-p101-2)

## Activities

Under the guise of the Oracle of Ellyn'taal, Ioulaum extracted a terrible price for the information he provided - the voluntary, permanent loss of some portion of the questioner's sanity or the knowledge of a powerful spell that Ioulaum did not yet know.[[6]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Ioulaum#cite_note-LEoF-p102-6)

## History

### Early life and The Excursion Into Extinction

Born in Seventon in [−3315 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/-3315_DR "-3315 DR"), Ioulaum soon rose to prominence when in [−3145 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/-3145_DR "-3145 DR") he led a major battle known as the Excursion into Extinction, bringing thousands of [Netherese](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Netherese "Netherese") spellcasters and [warriors](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Warriors "Warriors") to mount an attack against the largest concentration of [orcs](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Orcs "Orcs") in [Netheril](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Netheril "Netheril")'s land at the time.[[7]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Ioulaum#cite_note-N.EoM.2FWoN-p6-7)[[2]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Ioulaum#cite_note-LEoF-p101-2)

### The Mythallar Era

Ioulaum was most famous for his invention of the [mythallar](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Mythallar "Mythallar") in [−3014 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/-3014_DR "-3014 DR"). The mythallar dug deep into the raw, unfiltered magic of the [weave](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Weave "Weave"). The [arcanists](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Arcanist "Arcanist") of [Netheril](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Netheril "Netheril") used it to create _quasi-magical_ items - items that were permanent as long as they were within the one mile range of a mythallar.[[7]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Ioulaum#cite_note-N.EoM.2FWoN-p6-7)

With the establishment of the mythallar, Ioulaum created the first mythallar-powered item in [−3011 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/-3011_DR "-3011 DR") and the first floating city in [−2954 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/-2954_DR "-2954 DR").[[2]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Ioulaum#cite_note-LEoF-p101-2)

### The Rise and Fall of Netheril

Between [−2758 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/-2758_DR "-2758 DR") and −2208 DR, Ioulaum trained thousands of [arcanists](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Arcanist "Arcanist") to become archwizards in their own right. He also managed to greatly augment and strengthen his _mythallar_ using precious metals.[[8]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Ioulaum#cite_note-N.EoM.2FWoN-p77-8) At the height of the empire's growth between [−2207 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/-2207_DR "-2207 DR") and −1206 DR, Ioulaum frequently journeyed across Netheril helping to establish new floating enclaves or investigating strange magic.[[9]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Ioulaum#cite_note-N.EoM.2FWoN-p77-78-9) However from [−696 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/-696_DR "-696 DR") the stability of Netheril became steadily undermined by both the [Phaerimm](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Phaerimm "Phaerimm") and numerous disasters. This caused Ioulaum to become increasingly reclusive as he attempted to research ways of countering the threat of the Phaerimm, to the extent that he handed the day-to-day running of [Xinlenal](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Xinlenal "Xinlenal") to a number of archwizards.[[10]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Ioulaum#cite_note-N.EoM.2FWoN-p78-10)

### As the Oracle of Ellyn'taal

Since the waning years of Netheril, Ioulaum had survived by magic, but in [−371 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/-371_DR "-371 DR") he underwent transformation into a [Lich](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Lich "Lich") and created a lair in the [Northdark](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Northdark "Northdark").[[4]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Ioulaum#cite_note-LEoF-p98-4)

By [−339 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/-339_DR "-339 DR"), Ioulaum fully retreated to his Northdark lair and began training an ever-growing number of apprentices fleeing the decline and eventual fall of Netheril. It was believed that, during this period, Ioulaum was responsible for the creation of the first [alhoon](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Alhoon "Alhoon") from his [illithid](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Illithid "Illithid") students.[[2]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Ioulaum#cite_note-LEoF-p101-2)

In [329 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/329_DR "329 DR"), Ioulaum was apparently slain by a cabal of [illithiliches](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Alhoon "Alhoon"). Ioulaum's last human apprentice, [Tabra](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Tabra "Tabra"), witnessed what she believed to be her master's battle with his own students. This was actually a rite concocted by Ioulaum in an attempt to create an [undead](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Undead "Undead") [elder brain](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Elder_brain "Elder brain") upon which he would then merge his own sentience.[[11]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Ioulaum#cite_note-LEoF-p99-11)[[2]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Ioulaum#cite_note-LEoF-p101-2)

In revenge for her master's apparent death, Tabra slaughtered the last few of [Ellyn'taal](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Ellyn%27taal "Ellyn'taal")'s mind flayers by casting _[Ioulaum's longevity](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Ioulaum%27s_longevity "Ioulaum's longevity")_ on herself in the midst of the community. She then destroyed all records of the spell (except her own and those that Ioulaum himself had secretly hidden away) and fled to the surface.[[2]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Ioulaum#cite_note-LEoF-p101-2)

As late as [1372 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/1372_DR "1372 DR"), Ioulaum had survived in the form of an undead elder brain, known as the Oracle of Ellyn'taal. Only Ioulaum's undead servitors and the [ghosts](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Ghosts "Ghosts") of the mind flayers slain by Tabra remained with him. The few brave explorers who had stumbled upon the Oracle of Ellyn'taal had gained bits of [arcane](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Arcane "Arcane") knowledge dating back to the height of Netheril from their meetings with it.[[6]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Ioulaum#cite_note-LEoF-p102-6)
