### Expectations
This campaign is focused on the story that is behind the action. While fighting is an important aspect of DND this game and has many places to be useful, it doesn't have to be the only way to progress through the game. No encounter in this campaign has to be resolved with fighting. Diplomacy in a post war atmosphere is crucial to keep the powers at be from warring again. To add on to this Player Character death is a possibility, and must be taken into account. 

#### What you can expect from me:
1. I am human and I do get things wrong from time to time. Please be patient with me as mistakes happen, especially in this massive homebrew session. 
2. I follow the best rule in DND: The Rule of Cool. Meaning if there is something you want and it absolutely cool. Let's make it happen.
